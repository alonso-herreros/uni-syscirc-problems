## Installing custom package

In order to use the custom functions (necessary for most of the problems), you need to install the `syscirc` package.
You can do this by running the following command in your terminal (use `""` if your path has spaces)

```bash

pip install -e {repo_directory_path}\code\custom_libs\syscirc

```
